# Creating an Object Relational-database-schema-for-a-Travel-Agent
A simple task using Oracle SQL developer to model the database scheme for the travel agent FlySafe using the ER diagram and description of the organisation structure. 

The description of the system which was modelled is as follows;

The system is composed of many airlines. Each airline is identified by a code, name and head
quarterâ€™s address. An airline has different mile programs, identified by a code, description, and
starting date. The different types of flights offered by an airline have a unique number, day of the
week, departure time, arrival time, origin, destination, and stops (if applicable). Passengers are
allocated into flights and are identified by a number, name, address, sex and age. A passenger can
subscribe for one mile program of a certain airline. The system records information about the
passengers booked in a flight, together with the date, seat, pilot-name, and crewmembers of that
flight. The system also maintains information about the miles accumulated by each passenger in a
certain flight. This information is kept as a mile-order identified by a number, quantity and date.
For each passenger in a flight a menu is served. The different menu options have a code and a
respective description. The menu can be of type vegetarian, low fat, and kosher. For each
vegetarian and low fat menu, information about the protein level and Kcal, respectively, of the
meal is recorded. For the kosher type menu, information about the kosher regulation organisation
is recorded.
